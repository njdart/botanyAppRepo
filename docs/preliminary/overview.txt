OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

    Our proposed system is a computer-based, plant recording and tracking
    information lookup service designed to aid botany enthusiasts.
    
    i. Platforms and technologies
        
        We intend to use the following technologies and platforms in the implementation
        of the system:
        
        - Android:  Client requirement
                    Most diverse and most used mobile OS
                    
        - PHP:      Works best with university servers
                    Good support for MySQL connectivity
                    Help available within the university in case problems arise
                    
        - MySQL:    Works best with university servers
                    Free and widely used, with great support
                    Higher-performance alternative is unnecessary in our use case
        
    ii. High-level architecture
        
        The system consists of the following high-level elements:
        
        1. Android mobile application (RPSRrec)
        
            The application fulfils the following roles:

                -   Collect information about a visit from the user
                -   Allow the user to edit and delete local (not yet uploaded) recordings
                    and the species data within them.
                -   Obtain location data from the GPS unit within the mobile device to include
                    in the recording
                -   Upload the collected recordings to the remote database server whenever 
                    a network connection becomes available
                
        2. Website (RPSRview)
            
            The website fulfils the following roles:
            
                -     Browse and search uploaded recordings
                -     Provide detailed view of individual recordings
                -     Enable maintenance of recordings database
                
        3. Server (RPSRsrv)
        
            The server fulfils the following roles:
            
                -     Provide a public Web API to be used by the website and the mobile application,
                      enabling safe HTTP access to stored recordings
                -     Provide a MySQL database for the Web API to use as a data store
                -     Ensure data integrity and security
