Web rebuilding and testing
	In the occurrence that the website will be rebuilt and improved, the developers who are undertaking this will need to know specific information. There are two main places that the website files are located, the first being on daw54's public html directory on the Aberystwyth University server and a copy of this website on the projects GitHub repo. 
	
	The website does not require total rebuilding, as it meets the functional requirements, however, in the event that drastic improvements are made, then analysis of the current website structure and how the website communication with the Web API must be undertaken, as this is how the website functions and will continue to do so. The developer that will be improving/rebuilding must keep to these standards.
	
	If the website were to be rebuilt, the new website build would need to ensure that it is tested. The test specification is available and should be used to make sure that the website meets the functional requirements and the needs of the client.
	The testers will be able to see if the test passes as there is a pass criteria that if met, then the test is passed. 
	In the occurrence there are changes to the programming which has created a problem with the functionality, then additional tests must be added to the website test specification. This is very easily done, as the test specification was created using Latex. The user can simply see how previous test rows were created where they will be able to then understand how to implement a new test into the Latex document. If the tester does not understand how to implement a new test into the document, here is an example for reference:
	SE-F-(testIdentification) & (functional/extra requirement) & (test input & (test output) & (the pass criteria).& \\ \hline
	
	Where there are brackets, the tester only has to change the contents.
