Interfaces

    The server's PHP scripts that implement the Web API functionality use the 
    JSON standard to receive structured data from and transmit structured data 
    to its clients. JSON is used in conjunction with the widely accepted HTTP
    protocol, the JSON being carried in either the POST headers (in client 
    requests), or the HTTP response body (in server responses).
    
    All Web API commands need to be called via the HTTP protocol using the POST
    method, and need to be supplied the required parameters (either plain text,
    or JSON format, described in detail in the design specification).v
