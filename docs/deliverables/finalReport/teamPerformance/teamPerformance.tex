\subsection{Alexander (Xander) Barnes}
    Xander filled the role of project leader, he was well organized and motivated and drove the team through both internal and external deadlines on time. He is also a good supervisor/leader and was involved in all the major decision and helped teams reach consensus and compromise where conflict arose.

    Xander is a competent programmer who worked on Android development and the SQLite databases, as well as assisting elsewhere on the web and server applications. He largely organized coding week for the group, including timings, rooms and meetings between the teams to discuss implementation problems. The group feels he was fair to those who worked to deadlines, and gave fair warning to those who fell behind.\\

\subsection{Nicholas Dart}
    Nic Dart would take the award for the top coder of the group. Nic was voted in as the android manager to control the development of the app. Nic was also voted in as deputy project leader after our first had to leave the group. This was very important as Nic picked up what I missed or could not control like running sessions when I could not make it. Our Q.A manager also stepped down and Nic took over the job of looking after documentation on github making them all fix the template for \LaTeX.

    His main area was the android development, he did the major part of this development building the interface and data classes. He also built the methods which allowed uploading data and pictures to the database. He worked well in the group and got involved in discussions and has definitely made a hugely positive difference to this group.\\

\subsection{William Aldridge}
    William Aldridge has not turned up to 50\% of the project. I believe William did not interact with the team and was not involved in much of the product. He was given tasks to and did not complete them or did not complete them in time and meet quality standards leaving the rest of the group to do extra work to redo these parts. After a few months we stopped tasking him tasks as he didn't show up to meetings or complete the previous tasks. During coding week he was tasked at testing and reporting bugs to GitHub he did complete this very well. He did not get involved at all on the final document.\\

\subsection{Max Atkins}
    Max Atkins was voted in to the role of architecture. In this role he was put in charge of the communication of all the different technology groups, like making sure that the web would connect to the Server without any problems. He was in charge of checking documents to make sure the final project plan would work and was do able in the amount of time we had. During coding week he worked on the server side API scripts and the SQL database. Max took charge of design document coordinating the different teams, I believed this could have been improved due to a small miss communication between the server side team and the web team this was fixed in a meeting other than this problem, the teams communicated well and the architecture design worked well.

    Max contributed a lot to all the documentation and kept to deadlines well, he enjoyed getting into discussion at review meetings to make the best product. I think Max needs to step down a little bit sometimes as he does not listen to others once he has got something in his head. Max made a difference to this team and was a key member to the team.\\

\subsection{Max Harizanov}
    Max Harizanov took the role of head of the server team. Max had obviously had a lot of experience in the past with databases and building projects. Max built an API for the web and the android app. This API was built in PHP taking in JSON objects and storing them in our SQL database and also doing the reverse returning a JSON object to use. This was implemented over coding week.  Max also implemented AJAX to allow the website to do asynchronous searching and pagination on the site. 

    He has interacted well with the team, but sometimes wasn't a great team player. As Max is very experienced he knows specific ways and doesn't always listen to other ideas of approaching a problem. He built a over complex database system which went well over thee spec needed for this project. Max contributed a lot to all the documentation about the API and SQL Database and kept to deadline well, he was a key member off the team.\\

\subsection{James O’Hare}
    James O’Hare was voted in for the role of head of the web team. James therefore took control of the web team's documentation. These were done very well splitting the tasks up between his team. During coding week he ran his team well making sure they were up to date on there work. He built the inputting page for a specimen as well as other pages. 
    
    James could of improved his time management as was a few times late on deadlines but was good at organising others. He has interacted well in the team and have had a lot of input during review meetings, he was a key member off the team.\\

\subsection{Michael Pocock}
    I am unable to review Michael performance due to a lack of any work. He originally turned up to meetings and was not very interactive and did not put himself forward to tasks. His work hours would not reach over 5 hours. He did not turn up during coding week or made any communication with the team over the week.\\

\subsection{Sabastian Tuff}
    Sabastian Tuff has been a hard working member of the web team. He always put 100\% into the work. He was voted in as deputy QA manager and helped write the testing document.  During coding week he worked in the web team working very close to Dan. Together they built most of the site and it’s functionally including the CSS work. 
    Sabastian came to all the reviews and contributed ideas to the team. He was a great team players always happy to listen to others ideas and act upon them, I would always be happy to have him on my team, he was a key member of the team.\\

\subsection{Daniel Wilcock}
    Daniel Wilcock is for sure one of the hardest working members of the team. Daniel was in charge of the design of the site as well as all the form coding with the web team. Daniel took a lot of work of James when he was not as busy. Daniel spent a lot of time prototyping the website making sure it was ready to have the functionality added to it before coding week so coding week could be less about the design this made a great deal difference to the team as it allowed the web team to keep on top of there tasks and not worry about CSS problems.
    Daniel came to all the review meetings and was involved in discussions on how the documents could be improved. He also was always looking for more work to do and was a real good team player. Easy to work with and a key member to the team.\\

\subsection{Andrew Wilmot}
    Andrew Wilmot has not turned up to 50\% of the project. I believe Andrew did interact with the team well on the few occasions he turned up but was not involved in much of the product due to a lack of attendance. He was submitted task but did not complete them to time and quality leaving the rest of the group to do extra work some of the time. The task which he completed was the risk management and parts of the detailed design these were both done to a sufficient level.  He was voted in as Q.A manager but when being set the test document to run he did not allocate task and ended up doing a rushed job on his own that was not up to scratch. He then stepped down from Q.A manager where the job was left vacant due to no one waning to fill it. During coding week he was tasked at improving our documentation he did do this well adding extra tests to our documents suiting all the changes that had been made during coding week. Andrew also worked on validation for the website. He did not get involved in the final document. He was asking for work during coding week but i feel the team did not trust the work to get done or to a high enough level for them so the work would have to be redone.\\
