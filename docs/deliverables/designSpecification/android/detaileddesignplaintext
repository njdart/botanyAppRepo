Significant Algorithms 
In this section, psuedocode outlines algorithms to be used in the Android system. 

Algorithm 1 – Login 
Classes used : 
IsEmailValid 
isPasswordValid

onCreate do 
show login page
if user presses “Login” and IsEmailValid then
               if isPasswordValid = true then
		showprogress
		addEmailsToAutoComplete
		proceed to app page
	else
		show error message stating that the user has to provide a valid password
else 
 	show error message stating that the user has to provide a valid email.


Algorithm 2 – Check connection to server

While App is open do
	if User can connect to server then
		return true
	if User cannot connect to server then
		return false





Algorithm 3 – Grab information from server
While App is open do
	if checkConnection = True
		Get Plant Name, Image, Details and abundance from server 
	else
		show error message stating that the user cannot access the server

Algorithm 4 – Send information to server

While App is open and userLogin=True do
	if User is in add plant mode and checkConnection = True then
		Take current GPS location
		Display option for Plant Name                             
		Display option for Plant Image
		Display option for Plant Details
 		Display option for Plant abundance
  		if Plant Name/Image/Detail/Abundance is invalid then
			show message stating error
		Else 
			send information to database
Else 
 	Take current GPS location
		Display option for Plant Name                             
		Display option for Plant Image
		Display option for Plant Details
 		Display option for Plant abundance
  		if Plant Name/Image/Detail/Abundance is invalid then
			show message stating error
Else 
 		store information locally 

Significant Data Structures
Specimen Class
An object of the Specimen class will hold variables which contain data about the specimen, such as :
Name – The name of the plant
Abundance (Dominat, Abundant, Frequent, Occasional, Rare) – the abundance of the plant
Scene Photo –Photo of the scene of the plant
Specimen Photo – Photo of the Specimen
Latitude – Approximate latitude of specimen 
Longitude – Approximate longitude of specimen 

User Class
An object of the User class will hold variables which contain data about the user such as : 

User Forename – First name of the user
User Lastname – Last name of the user
User Phone Number – Phone number of user, formatted accordingly (eg 07…)
User Email – Email of the user

Visit Class
An object of the Visit class will hold variable which contain data about the visit such as:

Visit Date – Date the user logged in
Visit time – Time the user logged in
Specimen – List of all specimens entered so far
