Decomposition Description

1) Subsystems
The Botanist Tools application is composed of 3 subsystems:
- Android Application
- Website
- Server

Android Application

The android application provides the interface that users will use to record 
plant data when out on a visit. It implements requirements (FR1), (FR2), (FR3), 
(FR4), (FR5), (FR6). It must also conform with the requirements (EIR1), (PR1), 
(PR2), (DC1) and (DC2).

The application will have a form-based activity which can be used to add and 
edit new and currently saved recordings. Currently saved recordings will be 
stored locally in a collection, which will be awaiting dispatch to the server. 
The user will be able to view this list and select recordings to perform actions 
on (Eg. edit and delete). The application will not show recordings that are 
saved on the server. 

The Android application will communicate with the server to perform functions 
such as sending recordings and performing user authentication (?). The 
application does NOT communicate directly with the website and the database. It 
uses a web API which is core to the server.

Server 

The server will consist of two parts: 
- A database
- A web API

Database:
The database will be the central datastore for the entire system. It will 
communicate exclusively with the web API and serve as its back-end. 

Web API:
The web API is central to the system; it provides a uniform way of accessing the 
database for all subsystems to use. It maintains the integrity of the datastore 
by acting as the "middle-man" so that the other subsystems do not damage the 
contents. It exposes a public interface to allow a set of actions to be 
performed by the users of the API; actions include user authentication and 
recordings management.
