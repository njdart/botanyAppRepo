            \item editReserve POST request
            \begin{itemize}

The script will then set the url, the number that is being posted which will be the single record and then get a response.

            \end{itemize}
            \item Sort form
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This form allows the user to sort the list of specimens by a selected field and pick sorting order. It also includes pagination controls (next page/previous page).
            \end{itemize}
            \item Results table
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The results table is where the results of the current search/sort are being displayed. It is accessed by the client-side script and updated with new rows whenever
                new search results are ready.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Client-side scripts
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Showing the user search results is performed asynchronously, by calling the website back-end using a POST request. The back-end in turn goes to the Web API, and
                performs a search request. The Web API returns a JSON-formatted array of specimen results, which gets send back to the client-side for processing and visualisation.
                
                \item The script is able to react instantaneously to user input by placing event handlers on controls in both the sort and search forms, triggering a new request whenever
                a change in values is detected. The search value text field inside the search form makes an exception -- instead reacting instantaneously to changes in the text value,
                the script polls the content of the text field every second, and then decides whether to perform a new request to the back-end, thus avoiding an unnecessarily large amount
                of requests being sent.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    

    \subsubsection{filter.php}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This file starts with a new div tag that will contain the form that will allow the user to filter and sort the results. Once the this div section ends, the pagination will be there, where they will just be buttons.

However, if there is no image uploaded, then it will be assigned -1, which will make it that it does not exist. There will be another script basically the same for the other image that will be uploaded.

            \begin{itemize}

Before the submit, they will be empty, and once the form is submitted, the form will POST the data into the array. There will be two arrays for this, the first will be specifically for the specimen and the second will be for the user details. The two arrays will be then encoded into json and sent to the API.

The script first gets the API from Google, then creates the location where it wants to centre onto, which the information will be stored inside of a session. The function is initialised with specific options such as the zoom and the type of map. The map is then set. In the body, the map is then created.
