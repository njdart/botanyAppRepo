Look at commandName.php to explore how it works (with beautiful comments)

Chrome has a great extension to play with API: Postman

Use the API from my server: users.aber.ac.uk/mta2/groupapi/commandName.php

Available Commands:

addRecord.php (Encode a JSON called "record")
addResource.php (Send a JPEG called "resource")
getRecord.php (Decode the JSON)
getResource.php (Download the JPEG in PHP)

To do:

getRecords.php
modifyRecord.php
removeRecord.php
