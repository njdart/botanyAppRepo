Description
========================================================================================================
This is a group contribution that has resulted in a system comprising of an Android Application, a back-
end server with database and a website. This system is designed for botanists to keep a track of their
plant recordings out in the field, and in the comfort of their own home on the web. These communicate in
a professional and realistic way that protects the database from potential malicious entries. The 
Android Application and the Website do not communicate directly with each other or the database. 
Instead, they both communicate with a Web API server that controls all data inputs. The Android 
Application sends data from the field into the database, through the API, and the website receieves this
data and has the ability to manage it.
